## About me
Hi! I'm a mechanical engineer by day, but I love learning new things in my free time!
* Have dabbled in programming but never found the time to really *commit*
* As a teen I used to make super silly websites for fun using pure html
* Have no hobbies but love to do everything

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
* React / Redux
* Working toward learning the MERN stack

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) front end certifications
